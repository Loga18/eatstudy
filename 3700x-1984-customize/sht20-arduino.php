Author Johannes Winkelmann, Andreas Brauchli Maintainer Andreas Brauchli Website Arduino usually are 5V, the sht20 3. ino * @brief DFRobot&#39;s SHT20 Humidity And Temperature Sensor Module * @n This example demonstrates how to read the user registers to display resolution and other settings.  The LHT65 allows users to send data and reach extremely long ranges.  The Arduino IDE is simple, and easy to use, however it offers very little aside from basic code editing functionality It includes a built-in SHT20 Temperature &amp; Humidity sensorand has an external sensor connector to connect to external sensors such as Temperature Sensor, Soil Moisture Sensor, Tilting Sensor etc.  - Air Quality Sensor PMSA003 and SHT20 - Speaker, 3 Buttons, LCD(320*240), 1 Reset - 2. 1, 0.  DFN type package ? reflow solderable, SHT20 datasheet, SHT20 circuit, SHT20 data sheet : ETC2, alldatasheet, datasheet, Datasheet search site for Electronic Components and Semiconductors, integrated circuits, diodes, triacs, and other semiconductors.  CCS811 is a low-power digital gas sensor solution, which integrates a gas sensor solution for detecting low levels of VOCs typically found indoors, with a microcontroller unit (MCU) and an Analog-to-Digital converter to monitor the local environment and provide an indication of the indoor air quality via an equivalent CO2 or TVOC output over a standard I2C digital interface.  The Dragino LHT65 Temperature &amp; Humidity sensor is a Long Range LoRaWAN Sensor.  shedboy71-7th December 2018 0.  With my help, this part should be as easy This sensor chip is sht10 or sht20.
