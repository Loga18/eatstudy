As far as the 200 N-m moment shown on the y-axis in the figure, this is what is known as a couple, or a free moment.  Because r is the distance to the axis of rotation from each piece of mass that makes up the object, the moment of inertia for any object depends on the chosen axis.  Force 1 (F 1) = 6 Newton.  Rotate space about the x axis so that the rotation axis lies in the xz plane. 0 kg.  For part a) of this problem, the moment of inertia is about the x-axis.

The following are the mathematical equations to calculate the Moment of Inertia: I x: equ.  The moment of inertia about the x˜ axis for each segment can be determined using the parallel axis theorem, I x˜ = I x˜ + Ad 2 y.  Assume F = 570 N.  Recall that the moment of a force about any point A is M A = F d A where d A is the perpendicular (or shortest) distance from the point to the force’s line of action.  This is referred to as the neutral axis. 5 Moments of Inertia about inclined axis In structural and mechanical design, it is sometimes necessary to calculate the moment of inertia with respect to a set of inclined u, v, axes when the values of q, Ix, Iy, Ixyare known.

To find the moment, consider the dot product of Mo and unit vector along axis a: O: any point on a-a You can also find the tangent force Fθ and then r x Fθ is the moment about aa: Because r is the distance to the axis of rotation from each piece of mass that makes up the object, the moment of inertia for any object depends on the chosen axis.  Depending on the position of the axis of rotation, the rod illustrates two moments: one, when the axis cuts perpendicular through the center of mass of the rod, exactly through the middle; and two, when the axis is situated perpendicular through one of its two ends.  COM. moment about an axis<br><br>
